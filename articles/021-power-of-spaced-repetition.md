I had great success using a spaced-repetition system (SRS) and I'd love to share more about how they work and how to get started.

These spaced-repetition systems are well-known in some pockets of the immersion language learning community, particular among Japanese language learners. They have been popularized fairly widely 2008 or so in that space, originating from the All-Japanese All the Time (AJATT) community (unfortunately gone dormant).

The AJATT community was started by Khatzumoto where he outlined the method of using SRS for learning the ~2000 or so general purpose use Japanese Kanji. Khatzumoto actually picked this methodology up from the excellent article written by a website written by some folks that learned English to an excellent level.

The [series of articles on antimoon](https://www.antimoon.com/how/srs.htm)  are so excellent I'd rather not reproduce them in their entirety! So I'll keep it fairly simple here and encourage you to read further for more details.

Typical flashcard systems whether manual or using some app just show you the same cards over and over again, which can lead to annoyance and doesn't scale when you need to make hundreds or thousands of flashcards and review them over the course of years, potentially.
