# The Power of Spaced-Repetion Systems for Learning and Retaining Knowledge

I had great success using a spaced-repetition system (SRS) and I'd love to share more about how they work and how to get started.

These spaced-repetition systems are well-known in some pockets of the immersion language learning community, particular among Japanese language learners. They have been popularized fairly widely 2008 or so in that space, originating from the All-Japanese All the Time (AJATT) community (unfortunately gone dormant).

I've SRS for both learning Japanese and picking up some engineering concepts I needed to learn for a new area.

But first! Onto how spaced-repetion systems (SRS) work.

## How spaced-repetition systems (SRS) work

The AJATT community was started by Khatzumoto where he outlined the method of using SRS for learning the ~2000 or so general purpose use Japanese Kanji and for learning real-world Japanese sentences. Khatzumoto actually picked this methodology up from the excellent article written by a website written by some folks that learned English to an excellent level.

The [series of articles on antimoon](https://www.antimoon.com/how/srs.htm) are so complete I'd rather not reproduce them in their entirety! So I'll keep it fairly simple below and encourage you to read further on antimoon for more details.

Typical flashcard systems whether manual or using some app just show you the same cards over and over again, which can lead to annoyance and doesn't scale when you need to make hundreds or thousands of flashcards and review them over the course of years, potentially.

Spaced-repetition systems (SRS) work differently by using findings from neuroscience to show you cards at just the right moment when you might forget them, to strengthen your memory.

A key aspect is the daily review session for cards in your SRS deck:

* If you remembered the information on the card, you mark it as such in the SRS program so that the card is pushed or "spaced" further out. An example for a newly added card, it may be spaced between 2-5 days away to let you reach almost to that threshold of forgetting.
* If you didn't remember the information on the card or struggled you would mark the card appropriately and then you would likely immediately be shown the card again after reviewing the remainder of the cards.

## My usage personally of spaced-repetition systems (SRS)

### Learning Japanese

I used SRS for about four years while learning Japanese for two main purposes:

* learning the ~2000 or so Japanese Kanji characters
* learning real-world Japanese sentences

This was coupled with learning Japanese via an immersion-learning approach similar to what's laid out in [Refold](https://refold.la/simplified/) (no affiliation, it's just a solid roadmap).
