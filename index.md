![Pete LeVasseur](pete.png "Pete LeVasseur")

Hey there, I'm Pete

I'm an engineer that loves to learn new things and grow teams.

I've got a decade plus in the embedded and automated driving / ADAS space, working on real-time software in C++ and Rust.

Most recently I guide the efforts at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/)
to expand the ability to use the Rust programming language everywhere on vehicle
that it's currently possible to use the C and C++ programming languages. Put
concretely, this takes the shape of understanding relevant standards such as
ISO 26262 and working to fill gaps between here-and-now and higher levels
of safety-criticality: ASIL B+.

Feel free to check out my [contributions](https://github.com/PLeVasseur)!

Or my [resume](Pete-LeVasseur-Resume.pdf)!
