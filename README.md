# Pete LeVasseur's Blog [plog]

Hey there, I'm Pete ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer that loves to learn new things and grow teams.

I've got a decade plus in the embedded and AV space, working on real-time software in C++ and Rust.

Most recently I lead a team at General Motors on the open source [Eclipse uProtocol](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol) effort to create an open standard for Software Defined Vehicle middleware. I was primarily responsible for building out key infrastructural pieces in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) like the [uStreamer](https://github.com/PLeVasseur/up-streamer-rust) for bridging between differing underlying protocols, e.g. [SOME/IP](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-vsomeip-rust), [Zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-zenoh-rust), and so on.

Feel free to check out my [contributions](https://github.com/PLeVasseur)!
