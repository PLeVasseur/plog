Hey there, I'm Pete 👋

I'm an engineer that loves to learn new things and grow teams.

I've got a decade plus in the embedded and automated driving / ADAS space, working on real-time software in C++ and Rust.

Most recently I guide the efforts at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/)
to expand the ability to use the Rust programming language everywhere on vehicle
that it's currently possible to use the C and C++ programming languages. Put
concretely, this takes the shape of understanding relevant standards such as
ISO 26262 and working to fill gaps between here-and-now and higher levels
of safety-criticality: ASIL B+.

Feel free to check out my [contributions](https://github.com/PLeVasseur)!

Or my [resume](Pete-LeVasseur-Resume.pdf)!

## Safety-Critical Rust Consortium

I serve as lead of the of the [Rust Safety-Critical Consortium](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium) and chair for the [Coding Guidelines Subcommittee](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines).

The announcement by the Rust Foundation is [here](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/announcing-the-safety-critical-rust-consortium/).

## Media

Interview about Eclipse uProtocol on [The Rustacean Station Podcast](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/pete-levasseur/).

An [interview](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/diana-kupfer/%E2%80%9Cit-really-helps-have-welcoming-and-engaging-community%E2%80%9D) I had with the Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle work group on the future of open source in Automotive.

[uProto-what? - GOSIM Beijing 2024](<./media/uProto-what - GOSIM Beijing 2024.pdf>) given in a [talk](https://china2024.gosim.org/speakers/pete-levasseur) at GOSIM 2024 held in Beijing. [Video](https://youtu.be/YWcsv_9kNDU?si=AUfRi3pPM7dtsV9T) now available.

[My Open Source Story (so far!)](<./media/My Open Source Story (so far!).pdf>) given in a talk for students of the [software engineering in automotive and mobility ecosystems](https://seame.space/) program at [42lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/).

[Self-Referential Structs in Rust](<./media/Self-Referential Structs in Rust.pdf>) delivered at the [Eclipse SDV](https://sdv.eclipse.org/) Technical Alignment meeting to highlight how Rust and its ecosystem enables memory-safe self-referential structs.

[Rust in Automotive: Shifting Left and Shifting into Gear](<./media/Rust in Automotive - Shift Left - Detroit Rust 2025.pdf>) given in a talk at Detroit Rust. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhYewUhR5yE) now available.

A side quest being [interviewed](https://video.tv-tokyo.co.jp/you_nippon/episode/00126091.html) on 『YOUは何しに日本へ?』. Chatted about 爆笑問題's radio program [カーボーイ](https://radiko.jp/r_seasons/1015) being funny enough to learn Japanese.
