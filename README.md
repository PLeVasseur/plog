Hey there, I'm Pete ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer that loves to learn new things and grow teams.

I've got a decade plus in the embedded and AV space, working on real-time software in C++ and Rust.

Most recently I lead a team at General Motors on the open source [Eclipse uProtocol](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol) effort to create an open standard for Software Defined Vehicle middleware. I was primarily responsible for building out key infrastructural pieces in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) like the [uStreamer](https://github.com/PLeVasseur/up-streamer-rust) for bridging between differing underlying protocols, e.g. [SOME/IP](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-vsomeip-rust), [Zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-zenoh-rust), and so on.

Feel free to check out my [contributions](https://github.com/PLeVasseur)!

Or my [resume](Pete-LeVasseur-Resume.pdf)!

## Rust Safety-Critical Consortium

I serve as chair for the [Coding Guidelines Subcommittee](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines) of the [Rust Safety-Critical Consortium](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium).

The announcement by the Rust Foundation is [here](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/announcing-the-safety-critical-rust-consortium/).

## Oxidation Partners

I run a Rust consultancy that can support you on your journey to safer software! Feel free to reach out below.
